# Headings

This component will add a heading tag element to our code.

## Technical notes

This components accepts to props:

- `level` (default value: `1`) : A number from `1` to `6`, to set the heading level (i.e. `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).
- `typography` (mandatory): Any of the [supported typography IDs](?path=/docs/foundations-typography--docs).

You can check passed props to renderized components on hover `level / typography`;

### Using typography IDs

There are typography ID definitions you can use in your code rather than typing the
typography ID by hand.

**Using these IDs is recommended**.

Assuming the namespace of the typography is required as `t`:

```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.typography :as t]
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.typography.heading :refer [heading*]]))
```

You can now use the typography IDs defined in the namespace:

```clj
[:> heading* {:typography t/title-large} "Welcome to Penpot"]
```

## Accesibility

There should only be one level 1 heading `<h1>` per page.

Headings are used to navigate the page and must follow the `<h1>` → `<h2>` → `<h3>` → `<h4>` → `<h5>` → `<h6>` hierarchy.
For example, do not skip levels in the `<h1>` → `<h3>` hierarchy if there is no `<h2>` in between.

We should not choose the heading level by its visual aspect.
