# Texts
This component will add a text element to our code that will match the tag prop.

## Technical notes

This components accepts to props:

- `tag` (default value: `p`) : Give a proper tag name (i.e. `p`, `span`, etc.). 
- `typography` (mandatory): Any of the [supported typography IDs](?path=/docs/foundations-typography--docs).

You can check passed props to renderized components on hover `tag / typography`


### Using typography IDs

There are typography ID definitions you can use in your code rather than typing the
typography ID by hand.

**Using these IDs is recommended**.

Assuming the namespace of the typography is required as `t`:

```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.text :refer [text*]]
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.typography :as t]))
```

You can now use the typography IDs defined in the namespace:

```clj
[:> text* {:typography t/title-large :tag "p"} "Welcome to Penpot"]
```

## Accesibility

There should only be one level 1 heading `<h1>` per page.

Headings are used to navigate the page and must follow the `<h1>` -> `<h2>` -> `<h3>` -> `<h4>` -> `<h5>` ->  `<h6>` hierarchy.
For example, do not skip levels in the `<h1>` -> `<h3>` hierarchy if there is no `<h2>` in between.

We should not choose the heading level by its visual aspect.
